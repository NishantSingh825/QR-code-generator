A QR code is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode,
invented in 1994, by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts.
A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background,
including some fiducial markers, which can be read by an imaging device, such as a camera,
and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted.
The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both the horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image.
